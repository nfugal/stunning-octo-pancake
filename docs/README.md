#### The code behind NateFugal.tech

This is the repo for deploying my personal website/blog/landing-page. It is the 4th-ish iteration of said website.

I can't imagine it being much use to someone else, but if any of the bits here help you, you are most certainly welcome to them.

This probably would _not_ be a very exciting repo to watch/follow.

Build using Jekyll and the Minimal Mistakes theme.

-Cheers!
