## Who is Nate Fugal?

_Diving head-first into tech stuff since 1993_ (ask me about my first computer upgrade sometime) <br />
[Why '93 you ask? Well I was born in the 80's but didn't start my tech adventures until '93 or so plus '93 sounds good.]

I consider myself a breadth-geek—lots of interests, none particularly deep.

My current main gig is trying to make the healthcare experience suck a little less (Hi CH!).

I live in the good ol' U.S. of A. where I was born and raised.

Some bits from my personal credo that I deem pertinent to these introduction―type circumstances:

  + **I believe in being _kind_.**
  + **I believe in _thoughtful_ design.**
  + **I believe in _persevering_.**
  + **I believe _words_ are important.**
  + **I believe in _watching_ the credits.**  

_Remember, if something hasn't gone wrong yet, you're not trying hard enough._

-Nate
