## _Strange Planet_ is Delightful

I've been seeing comics from Nathan W Pyle for a while now, but it is just recently that I connected his other work with the delightful _Strange Planet_ series in my brain (I know, I know, I should read the creator info on comics more carefully).

In any case, if you aren't already familiar with his work, you should totally check it out. You can find some [here](https://www.instagram.com/nathanwpylestrangeplanet/?hl=en) and [here](https://www.nathanwpyle.art/strangeplanet).

I don't know of anywhere to read them all in one place. If you do, let me know. I'm [@nfugal](https://twitter.com/nfugal) on Twitter. Getting comments working on here is on the to do list.
